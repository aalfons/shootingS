# Shooting S-estimator for cellwise robust regression

The file `functions_shootingS.R` contains the implementation of the shooting 
S-estimator for cellwise robust regression.  Details on this estimator can be 
found in:

V. Öllerer, A. Alfons, C. Croux (2016). [The shooting S-estimator for robust regression](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-015-0593-7). *Computational Statistics*, 31(3), 829-844. 

The code was written by Viktoria Öllerer, the first author of the paper.  It is 
free software and comes with absolutely no warranty.  I'm hosting the code here 
in my role as co-author of the paper, since the website on which the code was 
originally published is no longer available.
